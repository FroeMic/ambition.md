          <p>
            OpenClaw: 200K stars in 3 months. People love it because it gives them their own agent. Proactive. Connecting tools and communication. The ability to automate. To program with words.
          </p>

          <p>
            <em>It feels like magic.</em>
          </p>

          <p>
            I have no doubt companies want this magic in the hands of their employees. But there&apos;s the gap: No setup without a techie. No identity layer. No permissions. API keys in plaintext.
          </p>

            The World We Can Build
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>We can build this.</strong> Secure agents for teams. Virtual employees with OpenClaw&apos;s power — but with security, governance, and multi-tenancy built in.
          </p>

          <p>
            We give every employee the ability to program their agent in natural language. We give them magic.
          </p>

          <p>
            In the future, every company will have AI employees — autonomous, always on, working next to humans. Not just tools. Colleagues. And we can build this future.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Let&apos;s put an agent on every desk and in every company.</strong>

          <p className="font-semibold">
            Why Now
          </p>

          <p>
            We are early. Clawdbot was written by one developer in 3 months. We are still in the era of exploration and experimentation. With the right team, we can build one of the winning products.
          </p>

          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-3">
            <li>
              <strong>Global market from day one.</strong> We win by building the best product.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>PLG motion.</strong> A product people want to share. Fast sales cycles. High-margin cashflows.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Frontier technology.</strong> Orchestration, cognition, memory at scale. Not another SaaS app. Fun to build.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Excited customers.</strong> We sell to teams that are thrilled about AI and the future — not dragging legacy industries into adoption.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Self-improving.</strong> Our own agents will help us scale.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Generational upside.</strong> If we build this right, our past achievements will look small by comparison.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            <em>Even if we fail — this is a vision so ambitious, I would try it all over again.</em>

          <p className="font-semibold">
            The Fellowship
          </p>

          <p>
            The team to win this needs: product taste, speed to ship, and GTM execution. I think we can build a dream team.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Michael:</strong> One deep realization: I draw energy from building and running an organization, not from coding. I want to lead this company. I want to be its face. For the first time in a long time, I&apos;ve seen a glimpse of the future — and I know how we get there.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Nimar:</strong> You told me the thing speaking against joining LF was that you&apos;d &quot;just be working on a SaaS app.&quot; Don&apos;t listen to me. Listen to your own advice.
          </p>

          <p>
            Build agents in the era of agents. Orchestration. Cognition. Memory. These are inherently interesting problems. Do you want to build SaaS for the rest of your life? <em>Or do you want to come with me and change the world?</em>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Felix:</strong> You said your perfect startup would embrace the quirky design taste you so clearly have. Well, here we are.
          </p>

          <p>
            Not quite physical robots — but one step removed. I don&apos;t want a future with soulless agents. I want agents as unique and quirky as Star Wars droids. Witty. Opinionated. Unique.
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;Trace anatomy.&quot; Fucking amazing. I need your creativity and edginess to stand out. Our brand should be as distinctive as our product. Build a global PLG motion from scratch. And yes, our brand color can be <span className="px-1.5 py-0.5 rounded" style={{ backgroundColor: '#ed702e', color: '#ffffff' }}>orange</span>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Together, you spent two years searching for PMF. Then two years in the ideation maze. I get it — that&apos;s a painful place. Here I stand with an opportunity to catapult us past those stages. Fast. Very fast. And we build it together.
          </p>

          <p>
            We&apos;ve taken scars from our first startups. The pendulum has swung. Our lessons push us to overcorrect. We should listen — but not too much.
          </p>

          <p>
            Most importantly: I want to <em>found with friends</em>. People I&apos;d hang with even when not working. You&apos;re reading this because I count you among them.
          </p>

          <p>
            This won&apos;t be 9-5. But it won&apos;t be 996 either. <strong>Growth = Stress + Rest.</strong> Outsized opportunities have velocity because teams tap into the right technology at the right time — not because they grind themselves to death.
          </p>

          <p>
            In a world of AI leverage, we hire outstanding talent that multiplies output. $10M ARR with a team of five is achievable.
          </p>

            The Fine Print

          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-3">
            <li>
              <strong>Focus:</strong> Build a great company. Aim big. Frighteningly big. Top-of-market comp to de-risk. If we miss → shut it down, not zombie mode.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Team:</strong> Exceptional team. 3 founders, 2 founding engineers with 3-5% real equity.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Equity:</strong> Equal split. 4-year vesting. 1-year cliff.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Salary:</strong> &euro;100K/yr from day one. &euro;150K/yr after significant revenue.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Location:</strong> Predominantly in-person. Munich or Berlin. High trust we figure sth out.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>When:</strong> Now. ASAP. Yesterday.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            This requires speed. Pre-seed from day one to pay an exceptional team. But I want a company where founders control the ship — not investors. Don&apos;t optimize on valuation. Optimize on deal terms. We control our destiny.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Ideal path:</strong> YC to dictate terms and multiply launch visibility. Then grow revenue fast enough that follow-on is optional.

          <p className="font-semibold">
            What If We Lose
          </p>

          <p>
            We build a useful platform. But competition wins on distribution. The path to $100M+ ARR closes.
          </p>

          <p>
            Competing globally means competing against larger resources. Even then: we will have built frontier technology (asset value) and a business with distribution and margin (cashflow positive optionality).
          </p>

          <p>
            Will we really have lost? We&apos;ll have grown enormously from it. And with you, this journey will have been fun.
